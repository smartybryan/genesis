				<h1>Who We Are</h1>
			</header>
			<p>
				“Our spiritual identity is enhanced as we understand our many mortal identities, including ethnic,
				cultural, or national heritage. This sense of spiritual and cultural identity, love, and belonging
				can inspire hope and love for Jesus Christ.”
				<br>
				<i>President M. Russel Ballard, Acting President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles</i>
				<br>
				<i>General Conference, April 2021</i>
				<br><br>
				As outlined in the Church General Handbook, section 20, Church activities are held to
				‘bring Church members and others together as “fellow citizens with the saints”.’
				With this in mind; the Genesis Group operates as a multi-stake activities group in the Utah Area,
				encouraging and supporting Black Latter-day Saints, their families, and their friends in building
				their faith in Jesus Christ, fostering unity, and strengthening membership in His restored Church.
				This is accomplished through monthly devotionals, special needs-based activities, and other
				opportunities for gospel friendship and fellowship. All Genesis meetings and activities are
				intended to help members more fully participate in their home wards and stakes.
				<br><br>
				As background, Genesis Group was founded in 1971 under the direction of members of the
				Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Currently, the group meets under the direction of the
				Utah Area Presidency and our of host stake president,
				President John R. Taylor of Draper Mountain Point Stake, with Elder David Frischknecht as the
				assigned liaison from the Seventy.

				<p>
					The Genesis Group was established in October 1971 by the
					First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
					as a dependent branch to serve the needs of African-American
					Latter-day Saints. Following the priesthood revelation, or
					Official Declaration #2, in June 1978, The Genesis Group continues
					to host meetings on the first Sunday of every month, and other
					activities, to support and edify all Latter-day Saints,
					their families and friends, and individuals interested in the
					LDS Church. The Genesis Group also provides assistance to
					mission presidents, stake presidents, and bishops.
					Elder David Frischknecht, a member of the Fifth Quorum of the Seventy,
					currently oversees The Genesis Group.

					A member of the original Genesis Group Presidency and former
					President of Genesis, Darius Gray, writes: "Genesis was, and is,
					a unique unit of the Church. We are like no other Church
					organization but our existence was brought into being by the
					direct actions of the First Presidency and The Quorum of the Twelve.
					We are not an auxiliary like the Relief Society but we are more
					than a 'fireside' while less than a ward. What fireside has a
					presidency set apart to a specific purpose? What fireside has
					its own auxiliaries? . . . Genesis is by design not like any other
					unit of the Church but there is beauty in that special calling.
					There is also responsibility. We exist and serve at the pleasure
					of the leadership of the Lord's Church. Our purpose is the Lord's
					purpose - we help to bring souls to the Restored Gospel."
					<br><br>
					Regular activities include the annual summer picnic, usually
					held the first Saturday in June, with 300+ in attendance from
					all over the United States and Canada. On the first Saturday in
					December is the annual Christmas potluck dinner. March brings the
					Brothers Breakfast and September the Sisters Breakfast.
					Other annual activities are held for Primary and the youth.
