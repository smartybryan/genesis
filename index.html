				<h1>Who We Are</h1>
			</header>
			<p>
				Genesis Group was established in October 1971 by the First Presidency of The
				Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as a dependent branch to serve
				the needs of African-American Latter-day Saints. Following the priesthood
				revelation on June 9, 1978, Genesis Group continued to host meetings on the
				first Sunday of every month, and other activities, to support and edify all
				Latter-day Saints, their families and friends, and individuals interested in The
				Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
			</p>
			<p>
				Today, the current purpose was provided by the late President M. Russell
				Ballard who said: “Today the Genesis Group is organized in harmony with the
				Church’s general handbook as a multi-stake activity group in the Utah Area.
				Its main purpose is to bring Church members and others together as fellow
				citizens with the Saints and to encourage and support black latter-day Saints,
				their families, and their friends to build faith in Jesus Christ, strengthen their
				membership in His restored Church, and foster unity.”
			</p>
			<p>
				Genesis Group provides assistance to the Utah Area Presidency, mission presidents, stake presidents,
				bishops, and ward organizations. The group is organized under the direction of the Quorum of the
				Twelve Apostles through the Utah Area Presidency under the leadership of Elder Kevin W. Pearson
				of the First Quorum of the Seventy. It is overseen through assignment by Elder Hutch U. Fale and
				Elder K. Bruce Boucher, both members of the Twelfth Quorum of the Seventy.
			</p>
			<p>
				Today the Genesis Group is led by President Ronell Hugh, First Counselor Thom Reed,
				Second Counselor Will Kennedy, and Executive Secretary Errol Balfour.

				<p>
					The Genesis Group was established in October 1971 by the
					First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
					as a dependent branch to serve the needs of African-American
					Latter-day Saints. Following the priesthood revelation, or
					Official Declaration #2, in June 1978, The Genesis Group continues
					to host meetings on the first Sunday of every month, and other
					activities, to support and edify all Latter-day Saints,
					their families and friends, and individuals interested in the
					LDS Church. The Genesis Group also provides assistance to
					mission presidents, stake presidents, and bishops.
					Elder Hutch Fale, a member of the Fifth Quorum of the Seventy,
					currently oversees The Genesis Group.

				<p>
					We are not an auxiliary like the Relief Society but we are more
					than a 'fireside' while less than a ward. What fireside has a
					presidency set apart to a specific purpose? What fireside has
					its own auxiliaries? . . . Genesis is by design not like any other
					unit of the Church but there is beauty in that special calling.
					There is also responsibility. We exist and serve at the pleasure
					of the leadership of the Lord's Church. Our purpose is the Lord's
					purpose - we help to bring souls to the Restored Gospel."
					<br><br>
					Regular activities include the annual summer picnic, usually
					held the first Saturday in June, with 300+ in attendance from
					all over the United States and Canada. On the first Saturday in
					December is the annual Christmas potluck dinner. March brings the
					Brothers Breakfast and September the Sisters Breakfast.
					Other annual activities are held for Primary and the youth.
