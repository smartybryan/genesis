		<b>What is the Genesis Group?</b>
		<div>
			Multistake activities groups are formed to give members confidence in their Church
			membership and a wider circle of friendships. With this in mind,
			the Genesis Group encourages and supports Black Latter-day Saints,
			their families, and friends in their discipleship of the Savior and
			membership in His restored Church. This is accomplished through monthly devotionals,
			special needs-based activities, and other opportunities for
			gospel friendship and fellowship. All Genesis meetings and activities are
			intended to help members more fully participate in their home wards and stakes.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			As background, the Genesis Group was founded in 1971 under the direction of members
			of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. The group meets under the direction of
			Elder Clark Gilbert as the assigned liaison from the
			Seventy with host stake president, President John R. Taylor of the
			Draper Utah Mountain Point Stake.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			The Genesis Group devotional is held every first Sunday from
			<b>6:00 - 7:30 p.m.</b> at <b>275 East 10600
			South</b> in the <b>Sandy Utah Crescent South Stake Center.</b>
			Although the meeting does not begin until 6:00,
			members arrive early to hear the Unity Gospel Choir International perform
			at <b>5:30 p.m.</b>
		</div>

		<b> Quote of the Month </b>
		<div>
			I must confess, my friends, that the road ahead will not always be smooth.
			There will still be rocky places of
			frustration and meandering points of bewilderment.
			There will be inevitable setbacks here and there. And there
			will be those moments when the buoyancy of hope will be transformed
			into the fatigue of despair. Our dreams will
			sometimes be shattered and our ethereal hopes blasted.
			But difficult and painful as it is, we must walk on in
			the days ahead with an audacious faith in the future.

<!--  HISTORY  -->
<content id="history" class="content hidden">
	<div class="small-indent">
		<br>
		<div>
			The Genesis Group was established in October 1971 by the First Presidency of
			The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as a dependent branch to
			serve the needs of African-American Latter-day Saints. Following the
			priesthood revelation, or Official Declaration #2, in June 1978,
			The Genesis Group continues to host meetings on
			the first Sunday of every month, and other activities,
			to support and edify all Latter-day Saints, their
			families and friends, and individuals interested in the LDS Church.
			The Genesis Group also provides assistance
			to mission presidents, stake presidents,
			and bishops. Elder David Warner, a member of the Fifth Quorum of the
			Seventy, currently oversees The Genesis Group.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			A member of the original Genesis Group Presidency and former President of Genesis,
			Darius Gray, writes:
			&quot;Genesis was, and is, a unique unit of the Church. We are like no other
			Church organization but our existence was brought
			into being by the direct actions of the First Presidency and The
			Quorum of the Twelve. We are not an auxiliary
			like the Relief Society but we are more than a 'fireside' while less than a ward.
			What fireside has a presidency set apart to a specific purpose?
			What fireside has its own auxiliaries? . . . Genesis is by design not like any
			other unit of the Church but there is beauty in that special calling.
			There is also responsibility. We exist and serve at the pleasure of the
			leadership of the Lord's Church. Our purpose is the Lord's purpose - we help to
			bring souls to the Restored Gospel.&quot;
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Regular activities include the annual summer picnic, usually held the first Saturday
			in June, with 300+ in attendance from all over the United States and Canada.
			On the first Saturday in December is the annual Christmas
			potluck dinner. March brings the Brothers Breakfast and September the
			Sisters Breakfast. Other annual activities are held for Primary and the youth.
		</div>
		<br>
		All are invited to attend, so come join us.
